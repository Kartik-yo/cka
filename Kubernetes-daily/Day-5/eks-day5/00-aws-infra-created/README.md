# CloudFormation Templates – GOLD SOURCE OF TRUTH

- `cfn-vpc-bastion-working.yaml` → The **exact live template** that created your VPC, bastion, NAT, subnets, routes, etc.
- `cfn-vpc-bastion-formatted.yaml` → Same template, just nicely indented
- `cfn-rev-cf-aasign.yaml` → Any extra stack you had (optional)

Never lose these — they are the blueprint to rebuild your entire network setup in seconds.
